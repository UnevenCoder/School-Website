      Dear Parents, Students and Friends Mrs. Humaira Naseem Welcome to Delhi
      Public School (DPS) Jeddah website! The founding members of the School
      were concerned about the development of the whole child â€” their
      intellectual, emotional, social, physical, and moral growth. This remains
      the aim of Delhi Public School today. DPS strives to develop intelligent,
      thoughtful, and caring individuals with educated hearts as well as
      educated minds. We never lose sight of why we are really here and that is
      to prepare children for further academic challenges and to guide them to
      be responsible, compassionate, and active citizens of the world. The
      academic program at DPS is notably challenging but sufficiently flexible
      to meet the needs of children with varying degrees of readiness and
      ability. Although significant attention is given to the academic subjects
      and the co-curricular programs it is believed that the growth of the whole
      child, including his or her attitudes and values, is equally important as
      any particular academic discipline, knowledge, or skill. Further, DPS
      strives to have a diversified student body. We are a community of learners
      who value and are strengthened by the wide variety of our members. We
      believe that diversity unites the academic environment and is of paramount
      importance in preparing our children for life in an increasingly diverse
      and complex society. We are a school where individual differences are
      respected, welcomed and valued. I am honored to lead a school whose
      mission exemplifies those qualities so essential to education in the 21st
      century. The promise of Delhi Public School is a hope for the future. We
      hope you are as excited as we are to discover a school that helps young
      people thrive as learners and become thoughtful, engaged leaders in
      society as well.
      <br />
