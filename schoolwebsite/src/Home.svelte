    Delhi Public Schools, with the motto "Service Before Self", have been
    serving the Society in the field of education for the last 56 years. There
    are presently as many as 130 schools under its aegis, both in and outside
    India. The growing number of schools under this organizational umbrella
    signifies how the need to provide meaningful education to a large number of
    children, desirous of growing into educated & liberated human beings, has
    been fulfilled. Founded and managed by distinguished members and luminaries
    of society, culled from the various walks of life, the organization has
    always guided its member schools on the path of progress with their
    visionary approach & lofty ideas. Consequently, Delhi Public Schools have
    become significant portals of learning and growth of young minds. Our credo
    is to provide an all round development & sound moral base. Fostering
    character building & nurturing the inquisitive spirit of children,
    encouraging scientific temperament & strengthening social bonds, are our
    constant endeavours. Surging ahead with a spirit of healthy competition,
    balancing a successful career teamed with a contented life, is the gift we
    give to all our children. Guiding us in this effort of ours is Mr. Ashok
    Chandra, Chairman DPS Society, who is our constant beacon and source of
    strength.
