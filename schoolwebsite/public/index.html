       Delhi Public Schools, with the motto "Service Before Self", have been serving the Society in the field of education for the last 56 years. There are presently as many as 130 schools under its aegis, both in and outside India. The growing number of schools under this organizational umbrella signifies how the need to provide meaningful education to a large number of children, desirous of growing into educated & liberated human beings, has been fulfilled. Founded and managed by distinguished members and luminaries of society, culled from the various walks of life, the organization has always guided its member schools on the path of progress with their visionary approach & lofty ideas. Consequently, Delhi Public Schools have become significant portals of learning and growth of young minds. Our credo is to provide an all round development & sound moral base. Fostering character building & nurturing the inquisitive spirit of children, encouraging scientific temperament & strengthening social bonds, are our constant endeavours. Surging ahead with a spirit of healthy competition, balancing a successful career teamed with a contented life, is the gift we give to all our children. Guiding us in this effort of ours is Mr. Ashok Chandra, Chairman DPS Society, who is our constant beacon and source of strength.
